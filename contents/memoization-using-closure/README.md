# Memoization using closure

This is mordified after [kentcdodds | epic react Memoization in general](https://github.com/ApolloTang/wf--kentcdodds-epic-react/tree/main/src/3-advanced-react-hooks/02-01c-useCallback--finish#memoization-in-general)

I also learned about this pattern in [egghead's just enough functional programming in javascript](https://github.com/ApolloTang/wf--eh--just-enough-functional-programming-in-javascript/blob/main/02-higher-order-function/)
